The issue stems from the direct use of mutable variables and references without sufficient clarity.  While F# allows mutability, it's generally encouraged to minimize it for improved code clarity and maintainability. 

Here's a way to rewrite the code to highlight the mutability and enhance readability:

```fsharp
let mutable x = 1
printfn "Initial value of x: %d" x //output: 1
let y = &x
!y <- 2
printfn "Value of x after modification: %d" x //output: 2

// Safer and more functional approach (using let instead of mutable):
let modifyValue (value:int) = value + 1
let x2 = 1
let newX2 = modifyValue x2
printfn "value of x2: %d" x2  // output: 1
printfn "value of newX2: %d" newX2  // output: 2
```

The preferred approach involves avoiding mutable variables and references when possible. Instead, using immutable data structures and functions often leads to more maintainable and understandable code. The functional approach in the above solution shows a more understandable approach that avoids the problems of unexpected mutability
